# RacingSimulation
Goal of this simulation is to make object find a way to complete one route of map with a big rectangle in a middle of this map.

## How it works
It uses one hidden layer feed forward neural network with 5 units, in order to dermine direction of its route and need of using gas pedal. 
In order to update weight and biases of neural network, i used genetic algorithm with mutation rate of
